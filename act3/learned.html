        <h1>WHAT I LEARN</h1>
        <p>I've always been fascinated by the world of programming,<br> 
            and JavaScript has been a central part of my journey.<br> 
            However, despite my dedication to learning and countless<br>
            hours of practice, I've come to accept that there will <br>
            always be gaps in my understanding of JavaScript. <br>
            It's a vast language with endless possibilities, and every time I delve deeper,<br>
            I uncover new concepts and techniques that challenge me.<br>
            There are areas of JavaScript that I haven't explored fully,<br> 
            and I'm okay with that. Rather than feeling discouraged by what I don't know,<br>
            I see it as an opportunity for growth. It keeps me humble and hungry for knowledge,<br>
            driving me to continually improve my skills and explore new<br>
            spects of this dynamic language.<br>
        <p>I was telling the truth, even the basic one I still can't understand.<br>
            I was making the chatGPT as my foundation in order to pass required activities. <br>
            I know that I have a weak brain especially in coding areas and I feel dissapointed <br>
            when looking my classmate know how to code.<br>
            I need a long practice for this and was hoping to learn even the basic one. </p><br>
